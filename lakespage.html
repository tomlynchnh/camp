<h1>Gateway to the Lakes Region
and the White Mountains</h2>

  <p>BELLEAU LAKE is one of seven lakes in and around Wakefield, N.H., the southernmost community in Carroll County and the gateway to New Hampshire's beautiful Lakes Region and White Mountains.</p>
<p>Our 200-acre, dam-controlled lake is home to an abundant warm-water fishery, including bass, pickerel and a variety of panfish, and a host of water fowl ranging from ducks to loons to great blue herons. </p>
<p>Access to the lake is limited to residents and their guests, and boat traffic is largely made up of cruising pontoon boats, not roaring speedboats. </p>

<p>We're 20 minutes from beautiful Wolfeboro and all the action on Lake Winnipesaukee, 45 minutes from North Conway, home of New England skiing and great outlet shopping, and less than an hour from Portsmouth and the beaches of the New Hampshire and Maine seacoast.</p>
<p>But for all the activity that's close by, you may find your favorite Belleau Lake activity is floating around the lake in an innertube with a good book.</p>
