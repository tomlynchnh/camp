<p>THREE GENERATIONS of the Lynch family, including more dogs  than they can quickly count, have called Lost Lure Lodge &quot;home&quot; for the summer since 1968.</p>
    <p>Campfires, stargazing, cookouts, flashlight tag, blueberry picking and rainy-day charades are all the stuff of precious memories.</p>
<p>Kids have learned to swim, fish, paddle and sail on the peaceful waters of Belleau Lake. And adults and kids alike have lost more than a few fishing lures in the search for the &quot;big one&quot; over the years, which is how our little cottage got its name.</p>
